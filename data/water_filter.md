## Introduction

Water purification is an important part of how humans sustain themselves on our planet.  It is also a process that leverages much of our knowledge of biology and chemistry, and requires many engineering skills to implement.

**Motivating Question**: Why do we need to purify water?

[Potential answers -- so we can reuse it, many water sources have become contaminated, water can naturally grow harmful bacteria, water gets dirty, etc.]

One of the most common protozoa that infiltrate our drinking water is Giardia.  [Fill in some other water contaminants to share with your class here.]

**Class Exercise**: Take 5 minutes and list some ways you may remove unwanted materials from water.

[Possible answers -- boiling, adding a strong chemical, putting it through a coffee filter, etc.]

What should be emphasized is that no single method will get rid of all kinds of contaminates. Public utilities use multiple methods in order to achieve a full purification.  However, the most common methods are *adsorption* and *sterilization*.  

Adsorption is when a substance bonds to the outside layer of another material.  This is a common filtration tactic, and is the one we will use in today's exercise.  On the other hand, sterilization is when external chemicals or reactants are added to the water in order to kill unwanted substances.  

## Making your filter

### Components

The first step is to make a container in which you will put your filtration layers.  A common, simple solution for this is to take an old 2-liter bottle or milk jug and cut it in half, using the end with the lid for your container.  

Our filter will have 3 layers (as shown below): gravel, sand, and activated charcoal. Pea gravel is commonly used along with play sand (like would be used in a sandbox) and both of these materials can be found cheaply at your local hardware store.

Activated charcoal is the most important component and it can be found at your local pet stores since it is a common ingredient in aquarium filters. Activating charcoal (or carbon) is made by taking a carbon substance and processing it to make it more porous and thus increasing its surface area.  All 'activation' means is this increasing of surface area so that there more sites for bonding to occur, allowing the carbon to adsorb many of the unwanted substances in our water.

### Putting it together

Once you're container is made and you've purchased your materials, we can begin putting together our filter.

Before using the sand and gravel, you will want to hand wash them in some water to clean off any grit or dirt.  No soap is necessary just use your hands and a tub of water.

The activated charcoal will need crushed into a powder.  This can be achieved most simply using a mortar and pestle, but if that's not available, it is possible to break it up with a hammer or rock by placing it in a sturdy bag and smashing it on a hard surface.

With your materials ready, you'll want to start by cutting a small drip hole in your bottle cap.  Then, stuff your cheese cloth or cotton ball into the nozzle of your bottle - this prevents charcoal from leaking into your finished water.  The activated charcoal will then be poured on top.  If you only plan to use this filter for a short time, you need very little charcoal, just enough to make a thin layer.  Then add an inch or two of sand on top of the charcoal, and an inch or two of gravel on top of the sand.  

With these pieces in place, you're ready to run your water through.  Find any water source or just add dirt to some water and put it through the filter to see it go to work.  If your filter runs slow, it may be because your cotton balls or cheese cloth are packed too densely.  Some people add another layer of gravel after the charcoal in order to get the water flowing again once it's been filtered.

This filter will **not** kill all harmful substances, but is usually good for rain water, filtering tap water, or any other moving body of water.  Stagnant water or swampy water should never be considered clean after this kind of filtration.
